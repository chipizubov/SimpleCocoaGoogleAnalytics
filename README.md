SimpleCocoaGoogleAnalytics
==========================

A simple set of classes of using Google Analytics to track your OS X app's usage.

## Usage:

Add these to your app's project:
* AnalyticsHelper.h
* AnalyticsHelper.m
* AnalyticsEvent.h
* AnalyticsEvent.m

Add reporting code to app launch and quit, and on relevant events.

See AppDelegate.m in the example app for how to begin reporting and send events.
